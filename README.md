## Background

While the Masters are on a refresher retreat on laser weapon calibration, the servers are groaning under the load of sorting the cadet records, in order to compute the binary search tree. Since you excelled in the Art of Algorithmic Sourcery, the team sends you the problem specification through the data radio link that you have established between the Source Academy ship and your crashed transporter. The hope is that your algorithm is faster than **merge sort**. You remember you have heard about **quicksort** before.

"Emmm, it is called **quicksort**. So, literally, shouldn't it be very fast? I bet that I could restore the name list faster with it."

## Some Historical Facts

**Quicksort** is an efficient sorting algorithm, sometimes also known as *partition-exchange sort*.

It was first developed in 1959 and published in 1961, by Tony Hoare, who is a British computer scientist and winner of the *Turing Award* in 1980. He was a visiting student at Moscow State University when he invented this algorithm. **Quicksort** was initially intended to be used to help translation between English and Russian.

&gt; The [Turing Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award) is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to "*an individual selected for contributions of a technical nature made to the computing community*". The Turing Award is generally recognized as *the highest distinction in computer science* and the "*Nobel Prize of computing*".
